```cpp
// Create AI agent with behavior profile
ai::AIAgentConfig config;
config.profile = ai::BehaviorProfile::AGGRESSIVE;
config.perceptionRange = 200.0f;
config.pathfindingEnabled = true;

auto agent = std::make_unique<ai::AIAgent>(enemy, config);

// Add to AI manager for coordination
aiManager.addAgent(std::move(agent));

// Update in game loop
aiManager.update(deltaTime, entityManager, collisionManager);
