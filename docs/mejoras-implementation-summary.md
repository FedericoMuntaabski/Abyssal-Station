### 4. Debug Systems Implementation

#### DebugConsole (F1 Toggle)
- **Command System**: Extensible command registration and execution
- **Input Handling**: Full keyboard input with history navigation (Up/Down arrows)
- **Player Commands**: 
  - `tp <x> <y>` - Teleport player to coordinates
  - `god` - Toggle invincibility mode
  - `speed <value>` - Adjust player movement speed
  - `clear` - Clear console output
  - `help` - Display available commands
- **Visual Interface**: Semi-transparent overlay with scrollable command history

#### DebugOverlay (F3 Toggle)
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time FPS monitoring and frame time tracking
- **Memory Usage**: Platform-specific memory consumption tracking
- **Game Metrics**: Entity counts, collision statistics, and custom metrics
- **Color-coded Indicators**: Performance status with visual feedback
- **Customizable Display**: Ability to add custom metrics from game systems

### 5. Auto-Save System
- **Automatic Saving**: Every 2 minutes during gameplay
- **GameState Integration**: Comprehensive state serialization including player position, items, and progress
- **Save Manager**: Dedicated system for handling save operations and timing
- **Non-blocking Saves**: Background saving that doesn't interrupt gameplay

### 6. Audio System Improvements
- **SFML 3.0 Compatibility**: Updated AudioManager for SFML 3.0 API changes
- **Fixed API Issues**: 
  - Updated `setLoop()` to `setLooping()`
  - Changed `sf::SoundSource::Playing` to `sf::Music::Status::Playing`
  - Fixed enum value references for sound status checking
- **AssetManager Integration**: Proper integration with asset loading system

### 7. Code Quality Improvements
- **Compilation Fixes**: Resolved all undefined references and linking errors
- **CMake Integration**: Added debug modules to build system
- **Namespace Cleanup**: Fixed namespace issues with AssetManager usage
- **Header Dependencies**: Properly organized includes and forward declarations

## Technical Details

### Build System
