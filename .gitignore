# =========================
# Project assets (ignore large binary assets by default)
# If you want to keep small placeholder files (like README), whitelist them with a '!' rule.
# Note: files already committed remain tracked; to untrack a committed asset use: git rm --cached <file>

# =========================
# User configuration and saves (local, per-developer)
# Ignore runtime config and save files which are environment/user-specific.
# Keep README files if present by adding explicit exceptions.

# =========================
# vcpkg - ignore heavy generated/artifact directories by default
# If you vendor vcpkg itself (vcpkg.exe, ports, scripts), keep those tracked but ignore
# large generated folders (installed packages, buildtrees, downloads and packages) which
# are usually generated locally by vcpkg and can be re-created.

# Note about already tracked files:
# Git ignore rules only affect untracked files. If a file is already committed, it
# remains tracked. To stop tracking a file that is currently in the repo, run:
#   git rm --cached <path>
# then commit the change.
